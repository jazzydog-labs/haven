2. **Comprehensive Documentation Audit** - Review all docs for accuracy (see `tasks/open/comprehensive-docs-audit.md`)
3. **Frontend-Backend Sync Workflow** - Automated type generation and API sync (see `tasks/open/frontend-backend-sync-workflow.md`)

## üîÑ Development Workflow

When resuming work:
1. Check this `todo.md` for immediate tasks
2. Review docs for implementation strategy:
   - `work-log.md` - What's been completed
   - `docs/roadmap.md` - Current sprint and backlog
   - `docs/commits-plan.md` - Implementation order
   - `docs/architecture.md` - Design patterns to follow
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Quick reference and doc directory
3. Continue from the next uncompleted task
4. **Complete the task fully**
5. Ensure all quality gates pass (see `docs/definition-of-done.md`)
6. **Commit immediately with clear message**
7. Move to the next task

**Critical**: Never batch multiple tasks into one commit. Each logical unit of work should be committed separately for clear history and safe rollbacks.
