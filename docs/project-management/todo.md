- [ ] `just type-python` - Type checking with Pyright
- [ ] `just format-python` - Code formatting
- [ ] `just check-python` - All Python quality gates

**TypeScript Development** 
- [ ] `just test-web` - Run React/TypeScript tests
- [ ] `just lint-web` - TypeScript linting with ESLint
- [ ] `just type-web` - TypeScript type checking
- [ ] `just format-web` - Code formatting with Prettier
- [ ] `just check-web` - All TypeScript quality gates

**Utilities**
- [ ] `just docs` - Build MkDocs documentation
- [ ] `just demo-diff-generation` - Full repository diff demo
- [ ] `just db-console` - Database console access
- [ ] `just shell` - Python REPL with app context

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Foundation & Organization ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Single Command Commit Viewer** - `just demo-commits` now handles server startup automatically
2. ‚úÖ **Reorganize Project Structure** - Cleaned up docs and configs
3. ‚úÖ **Complete Documentation Updates** - All planning docs reflect current state
4. ‚úÖ **Test All Commands** - Fixed missing commands (down, check-python, check-web)

### Priority 2: Development Infrastructure ‚úÖ (MOSTLY COMPLETE)  
4. ‚úÖ **Modularize Justfiles** - Split into package-specific modules with full backward compatibility
5. **Add Demo Commands** - Ensure all worklog entries have demo commands (see `tasks/open/worklog-demo-commands.md`)

### Priority 2.5: ‚úÖ Containerization - Phase 1 (COMPLETED)
**Completed tasks:**
- [x] Containerize PostgreSQL and FastAPI services (see `tasks/closed/containerize-services.md`)
- [x] Containerize FastAPI with hot-reload support (see `tasks/closed/containerize-api-service.md`)
- [x] Add Docker commands to Justfile (see `tasks/closed/add-docker-justfile-commands.md`)
- [x] Resolve developer experience issues (see `tasks/closed/container-dev-experience.md`)
- [x] Update containerization docs (see `tasks/closed/update-containerization-docs.md`)

### Priority 2.6: ‚úÖ Containerization - Phase 2 (COMPLETED)
**Completed tasks:**
- [x] Create docker-compose.override.yml (see `tasks/closed/create-dev-overrides.md`)
- [x] Implement migration strategies (see `tasks/closed/implement-migration-strategy.md`)
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide (see `tasks/closed/container-troubleshooting-guide.md`)

### Priority 2.7: Containerization - Phase 3 (Enhancements)
**Optional improvements (can be done in parallel):**
- [ ] Configure CORS and local domains (see `tasks/open/local-cors-and-domains.md`)
- [ ] Set up local HTTPS (see `tasks/open/local-https-setup.md`)
- [ ] Create production-like environment (see `tasks/open/production-like-local-env.md`)

### Priority 3: Frontend Development
6. **CRUD Frontend for Records** - Complete UI for Records management (see `tasks/open/crud-frontend-records.md`)
7. **Frontend-Backend Sync Workflow** - Automated type generation and API sync (see `tasks/open/frontend-backend-sync-workflow.md`)

### Priority 4: Next Development Phase
8. **Fix Any Issues** - Address command failures or configuration problems  
9. **Begin Next Development Phase** - Start implementing new features

### Active Tasks in `tasks/open/` (By Priority)

**Development Infrastructure (One Task Remaining):**

## üîÑ Development Workflow

When resuming work:
1. Check this `todo.md` for immediate tasks
2. Review docs for implementation strategy:
   - `work-log.md` - What's been completed
   - `docs/roadmap.md` - Current sprint and backlog
   - `docs/commits-plan.md` - Implementation order
   - `docs/architecture.md` - Design patterns to follow
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Quick reference and doc directory
3. Continue from the next uncompleted task
4. **Complete the task fully**
5. Ensure all quality gates pass (see `docs/definition-of-done.md`)
6. **Commit immediately with clear message**
7. Move to the next task

**Critical**: Never batch multiple tasks into one commit. Each logical unit of work should be committed separately for clear history and safe rollbacks.
