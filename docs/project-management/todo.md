## üìã Current Phase Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases
All foundation, containerization, and infrastructure tasks are complete. See work-log.md for detailed documentation of all completed work.

### üéØ Current Focus: Infrastructure Improvements

**CRITICAL**: Command structure needs improvement before further development.

Current next steps:
1. **Scalable Justfile System** - Implement hierarchical command structure (see `tasks/open/implement-scalable-justfile-system.md`)
2. **Comprehensive Documentation Audit** - Review all docs for accuracy (see `tasks/open/comprehensive-docs-audit.md`)
3. **Frontend-Backend Sync Workflow** - Automated type generation and API sync (see `tasks/open/frontend-backend-sync-workflow.md`)

### Active Tasks in `tasks/open/` (By Priority)

**Scalable Justfile System (Priority 1 - CRITICAL):**
- `implement-scalable-justfile-system.md` - Implement hierarchical command structure with validation

**Documentation Audit (Priority 1 - CRITICAL):**
- `comprehensive-docs-audit.md` - Audit all docs for consistency with current project state

**Frontend Development (Priority 2):**
- ‚úì COMPLETED: `crud-frontend-records.md` - Complete CRUD UI for Records management
- `frontend-backend-sync-workflow.md` - Automated type generation from backend

**Optional Enhancements (Priority 3):**

## üîÑ Development Workflow

When resuming work:
1. Check this `todo.md` for immediate tasks
2. Review docs for implementation strategy:
   - `work-log.md` - What's been completed
   - `docs/roadmap.md` - Current sprint and backlog
   - `docs/commits-plan.md` - Implementation order
   - `docs/architecture.md` - Design patterns to follow
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Quick reference and doc directory
3. Continue from the next uncompleted task
4. **Complete the task fully**
5. Ensure all quality gates pass (see `docs/definition-of-done.md`)
6. **Commit immediately with clear message**
7. Move to the next task

**Critical**: Never batch multiple tasks into one commit. Each logical unit of work should be committed separately for clear history and safe rollbacks.
