## üèóÔ∏è Technical Debt Tracker

### High Priority
- [ ] **Frontend Development**: Complete CRUD UI and sync workflow
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses across REST/GraphQL
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Auto-generate from OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Database Connection Pooling**: Configure proper async pooling for production
- [ ] **Logging Structure**: Implement structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Add before public API exposure
- [ ] **Metrics Collection**: OpenTelemetry integration for observability

### Low Priority  
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: Profile and optimize after load testing
- [ ] **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for hot paths
- [ ] **API Versioning**: Design strategy before v1.0
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Infrastructure & Scaling
- [ ] Multi-tenancy support
- [ ] Event sourcing for audit trail
- [ ] Webhook system for integrations
- [ ] Horizontal scaling strategy
- [ ] Service mesh integration

### Features & Performance
- [ ] Advanced GraphQL features (subscriptions, dataloaders)
- [ ] Advanced monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Performance optimization pass

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Development Environment
- **Issue**: Hot reload sometimes misses file changes
- **Workaround**: Restart with `just run`
- **Fix**: Investigate uvicorn watch configuration

### Testing
- **Issue**: Async test fixtures occasionally hang
- **Workaround**: Use `pytest-timeout`
- **Fix**: Review event loop handling in fixtures

### Documentation
- **Issue**: API docs drift from implementation
- **Workaround**: Manual updates required
- **Fix**: Auto-generate from OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas

## üîÑ Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks
- Update this roadmap with progress
- Review and prioritize technical debt
- Dependency updates and security patches
- Architecture review and optimization

### When Resuming Work
1. Check this roadmap for context
2. Review `todo.md` for immediate tasks
3. See `commits-plan.md` for implementation order
4. Run `just check` to ensure clean state

### Development Workflow
1. Pick the next task from "In Progress" or "Up Next"
2. Implement the feature/fix
3. Run quality gates (`just check`)
4. **Commit immediately with descriptive message**
5. Update task status in roadmap/todo
6. Move to the next task

**Never skip the commit step** - this ensures clean history and safe rollback points
