# Task: Add Demo Commands for All Worklog Entries

## Description
Audit all entries in `work-log.md` and ensure each has an associated `just demo-*` command that demonstrates the implemented feature. Update worklog entries to reference these demo commands for easy testing and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review all entries in `work-log.md`
- [ ] Create `just demo-*` commands for each worklog entry that lacks one
- [ ] Update worklog entries to include demo command references
- [ ] Ensure demo commands are working and properly demonstrate the features
- [ ] Add demo commands to justfile with clear descriptions
- [ ] Verify all demo commands can be run independently

## Implementation Notes
- Demo commands should follow naming pattern: `just demo-<feature-name>`
- Each demo should be self-contained and show the feature working
- Demo commands should include clear output/feedback to show success
- Consider creating a master `just demo-all` command that runs all demos
- Some demos may need test data or specific setup steps

## Examples of Demo Commands Needed
- `just demo-diffs` - Show diff generation functionality
- `just demo-graphql` - Demonstrate GraphQL queries
- `just demo-api` - Show REST API endpoints
- `just demo-health` - Test health check endpoints

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All worklog entries have associated demo commands
- [ ] Demo commands are documented in justfile
- [ ] Demo commands execute successfully
- [ ] Worklog entries reference their demo commands
- [ ] Demo commands provide clear success/failure feedback
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
