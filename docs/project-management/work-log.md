**Enhanced**: Real-time fuzzy search with visual feedback and highlighting
**Features**:
- Debounced search with 150ms delay for smooth performance
- Search results highlight matching text in yellow
- Visual "Searching..." indicator with spinning animation
- Shows number of results found instead of total commits when searching
- Highlights work on commit hash, message, and author fields
**See**:

## 2025-07-17.0008 - Fixed 5-second delay in repository browser loading
**Fixed**: Repository browser was taking 5+ seconds to load commits due to IPv6 DNS timeout
**Root Cause**: Vite proxy was using api.haven.local which attempted IPv6 first, timed out, then fell back to IPv4
**Solution**: Changed Vite proxy to use localhost instead of domain names for backend API
**See**: Repository browser now loads instantly (25ms vs 5000ms)
**Test**: `curl -w "\nTotal time: %{time_total}s\n" "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/commits/paginated?repository_id=13&page=1&page_size=20"`

# http://localhost:3000/repository/{repository_hash}/browse

# Features demonstrated:
# 1. Repository info display (name, paths, branches, commit count)
# 2. Commits show review status badges
# 3. Click commit to review - uses hash in URL
# 4. Diff auto-generates on page load
# 5. Search/filter still works with review status
```

Key improvements:
- Repository URLs use SHA256 hash of local path
- Repository page shows full info (local path, remote URL, branches)
- Commits display review status badges (Pending, Approved, Needs Revision, Draft)
- Commit review URLs use commit hash instead of numeric ID
- Auto-generate diff when viewing commit (no manual button click)
- Fixed diff HTML rendering using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Added migration to populate repository hashes

Breaking changes require URL updates in any bookmarks or links.

## 2025-07-17.0007 - Implement shorter repository identifiers (slugs)
**Added**: Support for short, user-friendly repository identifiers using slugs
**See**: 
- Database: Added `slug` field to repositories table via migration
- Backend: `apps/api/src/haven/infrastructure/database/repositories/repository_repository.py` - Auto-generates slugs
- Backend: `apps/api/src/haven/interface/api/repository_routes.py` - Supports both slug and hash access
- Frontend: `apps/web/src/pages/Repositories.tsx` - Uses slugs for navigation
**Test**: 
```bash
# Update existing repos with slugs
cd apps/api && python scripts/update-repository-slugs.py

# Test repository access by slug
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/repositories/haven

# Test repository access by hash still works
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/repositories/5b40a07c377e7430720d915e79de49488e11f04e95d19c04b4c0c8115ed7370c
```
**Demo**: 
```bash
# Start services
just run

# View all repositories with slugs
# http://localhost:3000/repositories

# Access Haven repository by slug
# http://localhost:3000/repository/haven/browse

# Features:
# 1. Repository URLs can use short slug (e.g., "haven") or full hash
# 2. Slug uses repository name if unique, otherwise first 8 chars of hash
# 3. API endpoint tries slug first, then falls back to hash lookup
# 4. Repository list shows slug-based URLs for cleaner navigation
```

Key improvements:
- Much friendlier URLs: `/repository/haven/browse` instead of 64-char hash
- Backwards compatible - old hash URLs still work
- Auto-generates slugs on repository creation
- Migration script updates existing repositories

## 2025-07-17.0008 - Repository manager dashboard and branch selector
**Added**: Complete repository management interface for bootstrapping commits
**See**: 
- Frontend: `apps/web/src/pages/RepositoryManager.tsx` - Dashboard for managing repositories
- Frontend: `apps/web/src/components/repository/BranchSelector.tsx` - Dropdown branch selector
- Backend: `apps/api/src/haven/interface/api/repository_management_routes.py` - Management endpoints
- Backend: Enhanced `GitClient.get_commit_log()` to parse git log with file stats
**Test**: 
```bash
# Bootstrap Haven repository commits
cd apps/api && python scripts/bootstrap-haven-commits.py

# Test repository stats endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/repository-management/haven/stats

# Test branch selector
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/repositories/haven/branches
```
**Demo**: 
```bash
# Start services
just run

# Navigate to repository manager
# http://localhost:3000/repository-manager

# Features:
# 1. Shows all repositories with real-time statistics
# 2. "Load All Commits" button for empty repositories
# 3. "Refresh Commits" for updating existing data
# 4. Branch selector in repository browser (dropdown UI)
# 5. Async loading with progress feedback

# Bootstrap Haven repository:
# 1. Click "Load All Commits" for Haven repository
# 2. Watch stats update (100 commits loaded)
# 3. Navigate to Browse to see the commits
```

Key improvements:
- One-click commit bootstrapping from Git repositories
- Repository statistics dashboard with commit/branch counts
- Branch selector UI component (preparation for branch filtering)
- Docker path compatibility (/repo mount point)
- Background task processing for large repositories

## 2025-07-17.0009 - Fix commits API and improve refresh functionality
**Fixed**: SQLAlchemy async query issues and enhanced refresh commits behavior
**See**: 
- Backend: `apps/api/src/haven/interface/api/commit_routes.py` - Fixed async query syntax
- Backend: `apps/api/src/haven/interface/api/repository_management_routes.py` - Improved refresh logic
**Test**: 
```bash
# Test commits API (was returning 500 errors)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/commits/paginated-with-reviews?repository_id=15&page=1&page_size=5"

# Test refresh commits (now loads only new commits)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/repository-management/5b40a07c/load-commits" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"branch": "main", "limit": null}'
```
**Demo**: 
```bash
# Start services
just run

# Navigate to repository browser
# http://localhost:3000/repository/5b40a07c/browse

# Features now work:
# 1. Commits list displays properly (no more "Failed to fetch commits")
# 2. Branch selector shows available branches
# 3. Repository manager refresh only loads new commits
# 4. Proper commit count updates in real-time
```

Key improvements:
- Fixed async SQLAlchemy queries using select() instead of query()
- Enhanced refresh to use since_date for incremental loading
- Better error handling and logging for commit loading
- Repository browser now displays commits correctly
