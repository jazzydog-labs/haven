## 2025-07-17.0001 - Fixed Caddy proxy port configuration for clean URLs
**Added**: Support for running Caddy proxy on standard port 80 without port numbers in URLs
**Fixed**: Port mismatch in Caddyfile.http (was routing to wrong port 3003 instead of 3000)

## 2025-07-17.0001 - Configured local domain access with reverse proxy
**Added**: Complete local domain access system with clean URLs and port forwarding options
**See**: 
- Vite config: `apps/web/vite.config.ts` with allowedHosts configuration
- Caddy proxy: `Caddyfile.http` with port 9000 HTTP-only setup
- Port forwarding scripts: `setup-port-forwarding.sh` and `remove-port-forwarding.sh`
- Test script: `test-complete-setup.sh` for validation
**Test**: 
```bash
# Test all access methods
./test-complete-setup.sh

# Test specific URLs
curl http://web.haven.local:9000
curl http://api.haven.local:9000/health
```
**Demo**: 
```bash
# Start everything with clean domain access
just run-proxy

# Access services with clean URLs:
# Frontend: http://web.haven.local:9000
# API: http://api.haven.local:9000
# Main: http://haven.local:9000

# Optional: Set up truly clean URLs (no port)
./setup-port-forwarding.sh
# Then access: http://web.haven.local (no :9000 needed)
```

Key features:
- Fixed Vite allowedHosts to support custom domains
- Caddy reverse proxy on port 9000 (no sudo required)
- Automatic port detection and configuration updates
- Optional port forwarding for truly clean URLs
- Comprehensive test suite for all access methods
- Works with existing domain mappings from /etc/hosts

```bash
# Check synchronized status
grep -A20 "Current Sprint Focus" docs/project-management/roadmap.md

# Verify completed tasks moved
ls docs/project-management/tasks/closed/ttr-commit-domain-entity.md

# See all completed work
head -50 docs/project-management/work-log.md
```

Key updates:
- Marked all 6 major infrastructure and frontend tasks as completed in roadmap
- Updated Current Sprint Focus to reflect "ALL WORK COMPLETED" status
- Moved TTR commit entity task from open to closed directory
- Synchronized roadmap.md with actual completion status from work-log.md
- Ready for next phase planning with clean tracking state

- Port forwarding scripts: `setup-port-forwarding.sh` and `remove-port-forwarding.sh`
- Test script: `test-complete-setup.sh` (validates all access methods)
**Test**: 
```bash
# Test all access methods
./test-complete-setup.sh

# Test specific URLs
curl http://web.haven.local:9000
curl http://api.haven.local:9000/health
```
**Demo**: 
```bash
# Start services with domain access
just run-proxy

# Access clean URLs (with port 9000):
# Frontend: http://web.haven.local:9000
# API: http://api.haven.local:9000
# Main: http://haven.local:9000

# Optional: Setup truly clean URLs (no port)
./setup-port-forwarding.sh
# Then access: http://web.haven.local (no port needed)

# Stop everything
just stop-proxy
```

Key features:
- Custom domain access via /etc/hosts mapping (haven.local, web.haven.local, api.haven.local, app.haven.local)
- Vite allowedHosts configuration prevents "blocked request" errors
- Caddy reverse proxy on port 9000 (no sudo required) routes domains to correct services
- Optional port forwarding scripts for truly clean URLs (port 80 → 9000)
