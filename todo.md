# Haven - Current Tasks & Immediate Notes

*Updated: 2025-07-16*

This file tracks immediate tasks and notes. For completed work, see `work-log.md`.

## üéØ Current Focus: Documentation & Testing Phase

### Documentation Updates (In Progress)
- [x] Create work-log.md from completed development 
- [x] Update this todo.md to remove completed items
- [x] Update docs/roadmap.md to reflect completed milestones
- [x] Update docs/commits-plan.md to mark commits 0-11 as done
- [x] Update docs/overview.md with new scripts organization

### Comprehensive Just Command Testing
All commands need verification after monorepo restructure:

**Core Commands**
- [ ] `just bootstrap` - Full environment setup
- [ ] `just db-up` - PostgreSQL startup  
- [ ] `just run` - API server with hot reload
- [ ] `just clean` - Environment cleanup
- [ ] `just down` - Stop all services

**Python Development**
- [ ] `just test-python` - Run Python test suite
- [ ] `just lint-python` - Python linting with Ruff
- [ ] `just type-python` - Type checking with Pyright
- [ ] `just format-python` - Code formatting
- [ ] `just check-python` - All Python quality gates

**TypeScript Development** 
- [ ] `just test-web` - Run React/TypeScript tests
- [ ] `just lint-web` - TypeScript linting with ESLint
- [ ] `just type-web` - TypeScript type checking
- [ ] `just format-web` - Code formatting with Prettier
- [ ] `just check-web` - All TypeScript quality gates

**Utilities**
- [ ] `just docs` - Build MkDocs documentation
- [ ] `just demo-diff-generation` - Full repository diff demo
- [ ] `just db-console` - Database console access
- [ ] `just shell` - Python REPL with app context
- [ ] `just logs` - View application logs

### Fix Issues
- [ ] Address any failing just commands discovered during testing

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Foundation & Organization (Prerequisites)
1. ‚úÖ **Single Command Commit Viewer** - `just demo-commits` now handles server startup automatically
2. **Reorganize Project Structure** - Clean up docs and configs (see `tasks/open/reorganize-project-structure.md`)
3. **Complete Documentation Updates** - Update all planning docs to reflect current state
4. **Test All Commands** - Systematically verify every just command works

### Priority 2: Development Infrastructure  
4. **Modularize Justfiles** - Break down justfile into package-specific modules (see `tasks/open/modular-justfiles.md`)
5. **Add Demo Commands** - Ensure all worklog entries have demo commands (see `tasks/open/worklog-demo-commands.md`)

### Priority 3: Next Development Phase
6. **Fix Any Issues** - Address command failures or configuration problems  
7. **Begin Next Development Phase** - Start implementing new features

### Active Tasks in `tasks/open/`
- `reorganize-project-structure.md` - **HIGH PRIORITY** - Foundation for all other work
- `modular-justfiles.md` - Depends on project structure being clean
- `worklog-demo-commands.md` - Can be done in parallel with structure work

## üîÑ Development Workflow

When resuming work:
1. Check this `todo.md` for immediate tasks
2. Review docs for implementation strategy:
   - `work-log.md` - What's been completed
   - `docs/roadmap.md` - Current sprint and backlog
   - `docs/commits-plan.md` - Implementation order
   - `docs/architecture.md` - Design patterns to follow
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Quick reference and doc directory
3. Continue from the next uncompleted task
4. **Complete the task fully**
5. Ensure all quality gates pass (see `docs/definition-of-done.md`)
6. **Commit immediately with clear message**
7. Move to the next task

**Critical**: Never batch multiple tasks into one commit. Each logical unit of work should be committed separately for clear history and safe rollbacks.

## üìù Notes & Context

### Project Status
- **Phase Completed**: Monorepo transformation with Python API + React client
- **Current State**: All core functionality operational, need comprehensive testing
- **Next Phase**: Documentation cleanup, then continue feature development

### Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ FastAPI REST + Strawberry GraphQL APIs
- ‚úÖ Git diff generation with HTML export  
- ‚úÖ Monorepo with Hatch workspaces
- ‚úÖ React client with TypeScript + Tailwind
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing and quality gates
- ‚úÖ Production-ready containerization

### Architecture Notes
- **Backend**: apps/api/ with Clean Architecture patterns
- **Frontend**: apps/web/ with React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Shared**: packages/ for future SDK and shared components
- **Config**: Hydra for multi-environment configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2.x async
