## 2025-07-16.0001 - Fixed Justfile syntax and configuration issues
**Added**: Resolved multiple infrastructure issues blocking development workflow
**See**: Justfile now executes all commands properly, configuration loads without errors
**Test**: `just --list` shows all commands, `just db-up && just info` shows environment details
**Demo**: All core commands now work: `just bootstrap`, `just run`, `just test-fast`, etc.

**Key fixes:**
- Fixed Justfile demo-commits recipe syntax (shebang ‚Üí inline bash)
- Resolved Hydra configuration interpolation error in database DSN
- Fixed Python linting issues (RUF012, SIM117, C401, SIM108, F841)
- Cleaned up imports and improved SQLAlchemy syntax
- Verified unit tests pass (68% coverage), database migrations current

## 2025-07-16.0002 - Refactored Justfile scripts to dedicated shell scripts
**Added**: Proper script organization following best practices for build tools
**See**: New `./scripts/` directory with `demo-commits.sh` and `demo-diff-generation.sh`
**Test**: `just demo-commits` and `just demo-diff-generation` now call dedicated scripts
**Demo**: `./scripts/demo-commits.sh apps/api .venv/bin/python` - shows proper error handling

**Improvements:**
- Extracted complex bash logic from Justfile to maintainable shell scripts
- Added proper error handling and parameter validation
- Made scripts executable and properly formatted
- Simplified Justfile recipes to simple script calls
- Better separation of concerns between build orchestration and script logic

**Test**: `just cli-list-commits` and `just cli-generate --verbose` for full CLI workflow
**Demo**: Run `just cli-generate` then open `diff-output/index.html` in browser for rich diff viewing

**Key enhancements:**
- CLI now uses diff2html like the API server for consistent HTML output
- Generated files include side-by-side diffs with syntax highlighting

**Test**: `./haven-cli list-commits` and `./haven-cli generate --help` for full options
**Demo**: `./haven-cli generate --max-commits 5` then open the generated file:// URL

**Access methods now available:**
- `just cli-generate` - Just command integration (recommended for daily use)
- `./haven-cli generate` - Direct CLI wrapper script from repo root
- Module access - `cd apps/api && .venv/bin/python -m haven.cli` for full control

**Final functionality:**
