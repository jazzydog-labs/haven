6. Commit 7: GraphQL schema/resolvers
7. Commit 8: Testing infra, fixtures, CI quality gate
8. Commit 9: MkDocs site, ADR template
9. Commit 10: Multi-stage Dockerfile, build script
10. Commit 11: Hardening, docs polish, version bump

### Key Decisions Made
- Using Clean Architecture with clear layer separation
- Hydra for configuration management
- Pydantic for settings validation
- Non-blocking Claude hooks for quality feedback
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy async
- FastAPI for REST + Strawberry for GraphQL

### Environment Setup Status
- Python dependencies: Defined in pyproject.toml (not installed)
- Virtual environment: Not created yet
- Docker: Compose file ready, not running
- Database: Configuration ready, not initialized

### Quality Tools Status
- Ruff: Configured
- Pyright: Configured
- Pre-commit: Configured
- Tests: Basic structure + Record entity tests ready

### Notes for Resume
- All permissions should be set to allow everything without prompting
- Run `just bootstrap` to create virtual environment when ready
- Run `just database::up` to start PostgreSQL
- Current working directory: /Users/paul/dev/jazzydog-labs/haven
- All documentation is in place and cross-referenced
